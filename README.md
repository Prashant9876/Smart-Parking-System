# Smart Parking System using IoT

![Smart Parking System](https://your-image-url-here.com/smart_parking_system.jpg)

The **Smart Parking System** is an Internet of Things (IoT) project designed to efficiently manage parking spaces, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance user convenience. By combining hardware components and intelligent algorithms, this system ensures optimal utilization of parking spots.

## Components Used

1. **IR Sensor**:
   - Detects the presence of vehicles in parking spaces.
   - Sends signals to the microcontroller when a vehicle enters or leaves.

2. **LCD I2C Display**:
   - Provides real-time information to users.
   - Displays available parking slots, status (occupied or vacant), and guidance.

3. **Arduino Microcontroller**:
   - Controls the entire system.
   - Receives input from the IR sensor and communicates with the LCD display.

4. **Servo Motor**:
   - Mechanism for opening and closing barriers or gates.
   - Ensures smooth entry and exit of vehicles.

## How It Works

1. **Vehicle Detection**:
   - The IR sensor detects the presence of a vehicle.
   - If a parking spot is available, the LCD display shows "Vacant."

2. **Reservation and Guidance**:
   - Users can check the availability status on the display.
   - If vacant, they can proceed to park.
   - If occupied, they are guided to the nearest available spot.

3. **Barrier Control**:
   - The servo motor opens the barrier when a vehicle enters.
   - Closes the barrier once the vehicle leaves.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Hardware Configuration**:
   - Connect the IR sensor, LCD I2C display, and servo motor to the Arduino board.
   - Ensure proper power supply and wiring.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the necessary libraries for the LCD I2C display.
   - Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board.

3. **Calibration**:
   - Adjust the IR sensor sensitivity to detect vehicles accurately.
   - Configure the LCD display to show relevant information.

4. **Deploy and Test**:
   - Place the system at the parking entrance.
   - Observe real-time updates on the display as vehicles enter and exit.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration with Mobile App**:
   - Develop a mobile app for users to check parking availability remotely.
   - Enable reservation and payment features.

2. **Cloud Connectivity**:
   - Store data on cloud platforms for analytics and monitoring.
   - Implement predictive algorithms for better parking management.
